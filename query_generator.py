Key Objectives:
1. **Efficiency**: Aim to complete the `List of Target Cells` with the fewest queries. Precision is paramountâ€”utilize search operators to refine results.
2. **Generalization vs. Specificity**: Your queries must strike a balance. A single cell requires a highly targeted query, while multiple cells necessitate a broader approach, potentially encompassing all information in one source.
3. **Learning from Past Attempts**: {('Note the unsuccessful queries: ' + ', '.join(exhausted_queries) + '. Your new suggestions must not replicate these fruitless efforts.') if len(exhausted_queries) > 0 else 'No previous attempts yet. Start with fresh, strategic queries.'}
4. **Search Operators**: Enhance query effectiveness with operators like quotes for exact matches, the minus sign for exclusions, 'filetype:' for specific documents, and 'OR' for alternative terms.
5. **Query Limit**: Restrict your submission to a maximum of 5 queries, even for extensive cell lists. Broad, inclusive queries are preferable in such cases.

Instructions:
- Analyze the prompt and `List of Target Cells` thoroughly.
- Devise queries, specific or generalized, based on the cell(s) data requirements.
- Submit your queries as a Python-interpretable list.

Remember, your role is crucial for accruing accurate, relevant data efficiently. Strategize wisely, ensuring each query is purposeful and potent."""
